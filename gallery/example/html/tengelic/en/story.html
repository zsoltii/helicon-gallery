The goldfinch was one of the birds described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Historiae animalium of 1555.[2] The first formal description was by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758. He introduced the binomial name, Fringilla carduelis.[3][4] Carduelis is the Latin word for a goldfinch.[5] The genus Carduelis was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 by tautonomy based on Linneus's specific epithet.[6][7] Modern molecular genetic studies have shown that the European goldfinch is closely related to the citril finch, (Carduelis citrinella) and the Corsican finch, (Carduelis corsicana).[8]<br>The English word 'goldfinch' was used in the second half of the 14th century by Geoffrey Chaucer in his unfinished The Cook's Tale: 'Gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe (Gaily dressed he was as is a goldfinch in the woods)'.[9]
